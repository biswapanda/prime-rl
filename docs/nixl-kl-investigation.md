# NIXL vs NCCL+FP8 KL mismatch investigation

Scratchpad / lab notebook. Append-only per iteration.

## Goal

Drive NIXL broadcast's step-wise `Mismatch KL` into a **bounded**
regime that matches the NCCL+FP8 (kernel-format) baseline behavior.

- **Acceptance (10 steps):** `Mismatch KL < 0.005` **strictly** across
  the first 10 steps. Per-step absolute numbers won't line up with the
  NCCL baseline due to per-run non-determinism; what matters is that
  KL does **not grow** and stays bounded.
- **Confirmation (20 steps):** extend a clean 10-step run to 20. Some
  slack allowed — isolated spikes up to ~0.007 are OK as long as KL
  stays bounded and doesn't trend upward. Sustained drift or a spike
  much above that = fail, go back to iterating.

The NCCL+FP8 baseline run is in flight (user). Record its numbers
when ready — mainly to confirm the "bounded <0.005" regime is
achievable at all on this config.

## How to iterate

Each cycle takes ~20 min. Budget is tight — be surgical.

### Monitoring a run

Runs sometimes hang or crash and the user may not be around to
notice. **I'm responsible for detecting and restarting.** Minimum
health loop:

1. `squeue -u $USER` — job still in `R` state?
2. `ls -la /beegfs/outputs/nixl-broadcast/logs/trainer/node_0.log`
   — file mtime advancing?
3. Grep latest KL entries — step counter still moving?

**Hang signature:** log mtime frozen for >3 min during the training
loop, or SPG barrier log lines but no subsequent `Step N` line for
>5 min. **Crash signature:** `Traceback`, `NIXL_ERR_`,
`remote index out of range`, `SIZE MISMATCH`.

**Restart protocol:** `scancel <jobid>` → fix the config / code if
needed → `source .env && uv run rl @ prod.toml` again. Note the
restart + reason in the investigation log.

Use `ScheduleWakeup` at ~10-15 min intervals during an active
iteration to poll without burning cache on empty checks.

### Commit discipline

Every experiment gets its own commit so any judgment call I made can
be reverted independently:

- One commit per code change being tested (hypothesis / fix).
- Commit **before** launching the run, so the SHA is the exact thing
  that ran. Use `git log -1` to record the SHA in the iteration log.
- Commit message format: `Exp: <hypothesis> — <what changed>`.
- Record the KL series + verdict in the iteration log below, along
  with the commit SHA. That way the user can `git revert <sha>` on
  any iteration where they disagree with my read of the trend.
- When in doubt about whether a trend is bounded vs. growing, err on
  the side of failing the iteration and flagging it explicitly in
  the log — false acceptance is worse than an extra iteration.

**Run NIXL broadcast (candidate under test):**

```bash
# On the nixl-weight-transfer branch
git checkout nixl-weight-transfer
# In prod.toml: weight_broadcast.type = "nixl" and comment out
#   quantize_in_weight_transfer (NIXL always quantizes).
source .env
uv run rl @ prod.toml
```

**Run NCCL+FP8 baseline (reference):**

```bash
# On main
git checkout main
# In prod.toml: weight_broadcast.type = "nccl" and
#   quantize_in_weight_transfer = true (uncomment).
source .env
uv run rl @ prod.toml
```

## Reading Mismatch KL from logs

Per-step summary lines land in the trainer rank-0 log. The output dir
is wiped between runs (`clean_output_dir = true` in `prod.toml`), so
extract KL values *before* the next run starts:

```bash
# Latest running / just-finished job:
ls -lat /beegfs/outputs/nixl-broadcast/logs/trainer/node_0.log
# Per-step line pattern:
# SUCCESS Step N | Time: Xs | Loss: ... | Entropy: ... | Mismatch KL: Y | ...
```

If the log has ANSI color codes, strip with
`sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g'` before grepping. The slurm stdout
`job_NNN.log` also captures this.

## Current NIXL state — last run before investigation started

- NIXL branch `nixl-weight-transfer` head: `f23d68b52` (FP8 scale
  floor = 1e-12, HSDP support, EP partition assertion, post-refactor).
- NCCL baseline branch `main` head: `6bf14b80f` (vf bump).

Run submitted via `uv run rl @ prod.toml` on NIXL branch at
`f23d68b52`. Output dir was wiped before I could re-check; values
below are from a pre-wipe scrape.

| Step | Mismatch KL |
|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.0022 |
| 1 | 0.0016 |
| 2 | 0.0027 |
| 3 | 0.0033 |
| 4 | 0.0033 |
| 5 | 0.0038 |
| 6 | 0.0060 |
| 7 | 0.0050 |
| 8 | 0.0062 |
| 9 | 0.0059 |
| 10 | 0.0082 |
| 11 | 0.0120 |
| 12 | 0.0227 |
| 13 | 0.0110 |
| 14 | 0.0142 |
| 15 | 0.0354 |
| 16 | 0.0198 |

**Trend:** drift from ~0.002 at step 0 to ~0.02-0.03 by step 15-16,
with at least one spike (step 15 = 0.035). Not a one-shot bug — looks
like accumulating error across pushes.

## Suspect list (hypotheses to check against baseline)

Ordered by my current priority:

1. **Scale-buffer layout / offset bug at inference-side narrow.** The
   refactor moved from one flat `non_expert_layout` dict to per-slot
   `LayoutEntry`s. For FP8-quantized fused specs (e.g. fused_qkv_a)
   the weight goes into offset regions via `narrow(0, offset_rows,
   rows)`, and so does the scale via `scale_offset_rows`. The
   `_infer_nixl_trainer_ws` / `dp_shard_cp` change might also
   re-index scales differently from before. Worth verifying the
   scale buffer is written at the right byte offset end-to-end.

2. **DTensor `to_local()` vs `full_tensor()` for per-shard FP8.**
   `_resolve_source` returns `to_local()` when slot_rows != src_rows.
   For FP8-quantized per-shard slots, quantizing only the local
   shard is bit-exact only if the shard boundary is 128-row-aligned
   AND if the source's tensor-parallel sharding matches the FSDP
   shard axis we're reading. If a param is actually replicated (not
   sharded), `to_local()` returns the local copy but `src.shape[0]
   == slot_rows` may be False due to DTensor's reported shape — need
   to verify per-shard dispatch gate is doing the right thing when
   a source is Replicate() rather than Shard(0).

3. **Post-refactor chunked write ordering.** Previously all writes
   went into the write table in a specific order. Now
   `slot.build_writes(peers)` iterates per-slot. If we accidentally
   wrote `weight` and `weight_scale_inv` to the wrong peer (e.g.
   weight to prefill-0, scale to prefill-1 when they correspond to
   different global experts), inference would see a
   weight/scale mismatch.

4. **HSDP shard-rank mismatch.** My recent HSDP change moved
   `my_rank` from global `dist.get_rank()` to
   `dp_shard_cp.get_local_rank()`. On `dp_replicate=1` these are
   identical, but there may be a subtle bug if the mesh's
   dp_shard_cp rank ordering differs from `dist.get_rank() %
   (dp_shard × cp)` on the primary replica. Worth assertion-checking.

5. **Expert slot mapping: local expert idx → remote chunk idx.** The
   routing computes `remote_chunk_idx = peer_experts.index(global_id)`.
   If the peer's `expert_map[moe_prefix]` ordering on inference
   differs from what the trainer expects, experts end up in the
   wrong slots on inference. This used to work in the old NCCL+FP8
   path because the whole expert table was shipped atomically with
   the routing info; in NIXL we key per-write on expert_map.

6. **Shared expert naming / shape handling.** Old code had a
   `sw.ndim == 3` squeeze path for legacy checkpoints. New code
   doesn't. If the model ever produces 3D shared expert params
   (shouldn't, but worth confirming on GLM-5.1 state_dict), the new
   path would shape-mismatch silently.

7. **Scale dtype mismatch.** FP8 kernel writes fp32 scale. Inference
   may expect `torch.float32` or `torch.float32` with column-major
   layout. If we write row-major and vLLM reads column-major, the
   saved scales look transposed.

## Instrumentation ideas (low risk, high information)

Before chasing hypotheses, add a one-shot numeric check per push:

- Trainer side: for a canonical layer (e.g. layer 3
  `self_attn.fused_qkv_a_proj`), compute `weight.float().sum()` +
  `scale.sum()` after `convert()` but before post_write. Log it.
- Inference side: after `update_weights_from_path`, for the same
  layer, read the vLLM param + scale buffer, compute the same sums.
  Log it.
- If trainer sum != inference sum for any slot, it's a write-table
  bug (hypothesis 1, 3, or 5). If they match but KL still diverges,
  it's a quantization / dequantization parity bug (hypothesis 2 or
  7).

Also useful: run NIXL with `flush_every=1` (instead of 100). If a
larger batch of pending writes is what corrupts ordering, per-write
drain will make the bug go away. Slow but definitive.

## Investigation log

### Iteration 0 — NCCL+FP8 baseline captured

Branch `main` @ `6bf14b80f`. `prod.toml`: `weight_broadcast.type =
"nccl"` + `quantize_in_weight_transfer = true`. Job 5647, 11 steps
observed before cancel:

| Step | KL | Step | KL |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.0004 | 6 | 0.0011 |
| 1 | 0.0022 | 7 | 0.0016 |
| 2 | 0.0010 | 8 | 0.0000 |
| 3 | 0.0015 | 9 | 0.0007 |
| 4 | 0.0015 | 10 | 0.0016 |
| 5 | 0.0010 | | |

Max KL: 0.0022 (step 1). All 11 steps under 0.003, well inside the
<0.005 bound. The bounded regime is reachable on this config.

**Reference NIXL run (previous, same SHA `f23d68b52`):** 0.002 → 0.035
over 17 steps. Fails the bound at step 11+. That's what we're fixing.

### Iteration 1 — reproduce NIXL drift on current SHA (baseline)

SHA: `81be8e763` (investigation doc commit on top of `f23d68b52`; no
numerical code changes). `prod.toml`: NIXL, wandb
`nixl-iter1-repro`. Job 5648.

| Step | KL | | Step | KL |
|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.0026 | | 5 | 0.0027 |
| 1 | 0.0016 | | 6 | **0.0064** |
| 2 | 0.0032 | | 7 | **0.0051** |
| 3 | 0.0006 | | 8 | **0.0062** |
| 4 | 0.0046 | | 9 | **0.0075** |

**Verdict:** FAIL. KL breaks 0.005 at step 6 and stays elevated.
Matches prior run qualitatively (steady slow upward drift). Drift is
deterministic, not noise. Good diagnostic baseline to work from.

Cancelled at step 9.

### Iteration 2 — end-to-end signature diagnostic

Hypothesis: transport isn't faithful across steps. Add per-step
signature logs on both trainer and inference sides for a canonical
anchor slot. If signatures match every step but KL still grows, the
transport is fine and the drift is in quantization/dequantization
consistency. If signatures diverge, it's a transport/addressing bug.

- Anchor: `model.layers.3.input_layernorm.weight` — small, 1D
  bf16, non-quantized, GatheredSlot (full tensor on every trainer
  rank; rank 0 writes once per inference peer round-robin).
- Trainer rank-0 log after `slot.convert()` (before post_write):
  `[nixl SIG trainer] key=... sum=... shape=...`
- Inference (all workers) log after SPG barrier:
  `[nixl SIG inference] key=... sum=... shape=...`
- Expected: trainer step N's sum should equal every inference
  worker's sum for that step. Drift = write bug.
- `prod.toml` unchanged (still NIXL). Wandb name
  `nixl-iter2-sigdiag`.

Job 5650, 10 steps observed:

| Step | KL |
|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.0024 |
| 1 | 0.0015 |
| 2 | 0.0014 |
| 3 | 0.0038 |
| 4 | 0.0037 |
| 5 | 0.0021 |
| 6 | **0.0067** |
| 7 | 0.0032 |
| 8 | **0.0057** |
| 9 | 0.0034 |

**Verdict on KL:** FAIL — breaks 0.005 at step 6. Consistent with
iter1 (different numbers, same shape).

**SIG comparison, `model.layers.3.input_layernorm.weight`:**

| Step | Trainer sum | All 32 inference workers |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 249.99527359 | 249.99527359 ✓ |
| 1 | 249.99526978 | 249.99526978 ✓ |
| 2 | 249.99527359 | 249.99527359 ✓ |
| 3 | 249.99527359 | 249.99527359 ✓ |
| ... | all match | all match |

**Key result:** transport is bit-exact for the bf16 GatheredSlot. KL
drift does NOT come from this slot type. Rules out a broad transport
bug. Problem is in FP8-quantized slots or ExpertSlots (or in how
inference uses them). Next: expand anchors to F (fp8 gather) and E
(expert) to localize.

### Iteration 3 — expand signature diagnostic to FP8 + expert slots

SHA will be added post-commit. Adds anchors:
- **F** `model.layers.3.self_attn.kv_b_proj.weight` — FP8 gathered
  (rows=28672, fsdp_total=64 → per-shard rows=448, fails 128-align
  gate → GatheredSlot fp8).
- **E** `model.layers.3.mlp.experts.w13_weight[0]` — ExpertSlot fp8
  grouped, expert 0 specifically. Trainer rank 0 owns experts
  [0..4); inference worker that owns global expert 0 (via its
  `expert_map`) logs the local index.

Wandb name `nixl-iter3-sigdiag-3anchors`.

Job 5653, 11 steps observed (KL drifts: breaks 0.005 at steps 4, 6,
8, 10 — matches iter1 drift pattern).

**Trainer SIG (rank 0, anchor stepwise):**
- G: `249.99527359 → 249.99527359 → ... → 249.99527740` (bf16 noise).
- F w_bytes: `2300248320 → 2300245929 → 2300253387 → ...` (changes).
- E w_bytes: `3793815079 → 3793813458 → 3793823409 → ...` (changes).

**Inference SIG (all workers matched):**

| Step | Anchor | Trainer | Inference | Match |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | G w | 249.99527359 | 249.99527359 | ✓ |
| 0 | F w_bytes | 2300248320 | 2300248320 | ✓ |
| 0 | F scale | 0.10161374 | **0.00000000** | ✗ |
| 0 | E w_bytes | 3793815079 | 3793815079 | ✓ |
| 0 | E scale | 0.27224183 | **0.00000000** | ✗ |

**Interpretation:** FP8 weight bytes match. Scales read as 0 on
inference — almost certainly a diagnostic bug: vLLM stores
`weight_scale_inv` as a `Parameter`, not a `Buffer`, so my
`named_bufs[...]` lookup returns nothing and I print 0. Need to
check both `named_parameters()` and `named_buffers()`.

### Iteration 4 — fix scale lookup on inference diagnostic

Same anchors, but the inference-side `_lookup()` helper now checks
both `named_parameters` and `named_buffers`, and logs the location
(`loc=param/buf/MISSING`) so we can tell.

Wandb name `nixl-iter4-sigdiag-scalefix`.

Job 5657. Key inference-side SIG observations (all 32 workers, step 0):

| Anchor | loc | Trainer | Inference | Match |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| G | param | 249.99527359 | 249.99527359 | ✓ |
| F | param/param | w=2300248861 s=0.10161349 | w=2300248861 s=0.10161349 | ✓ |
| E | param/param | w=3793830601 s=0.27224205 | w=3793830601 s=0.27224205 | ✓ |

Both FP8 weight AND scale match bit-exact on all three slot types.
Transport is fully verified. KL drift is NOT a transport bug. It's
elsewhere.

**KL series (iter4), same deterministic pattern:**
0.0021, 0.0031, 0.0006, 0.0012, 0.0049, 0.0038, 0.0021, 0.0045, **0.0050** → fails bound.

**Analysis:** vLLM's `Fp8LinearMethod.process_weights_after_loading`
calls `maybe_post_process_fp8_weight_block` when
`use_deep_gemm=True`, which runs `transform_sf_into_required_layout`
to permute `weight_scale_inv` into a DeepGemm-specific layout. This
happens ONCE at initial model load. After that, both NCCL+FP8 and
NIXL paths `copy_` raw blockwise scales over the transformed scales
— DG then reads the raw values in the transformed layout → wrong
GEMM output.

The NCCL baseline shows KL ~0.001 while NIXL shows ~0.002-0.03; if
this hypothesis is correct, NCCL is also slightly broken but just
less bad for reasons unclear. The cleanest way to falsify is to
disable DeepGemm entirely and see if NIXL becomes bounded.

### Iteration 5 — disable `use_deep_gemm` to falsify DG layout hypothesis

Single change in `prod.toml`: `inference.use_deep_gemm = false`.
All SIG diagnostics stay. Wandb name `nixl-iter5-no-deep-gemm`.

If NIXL KL stays bounded <0.005 → DG layout mismatch is the bug,
and the fix is either (a) re-run the DG layout transform after
writes, or (b) keep DG off, or (c) have trainer write scales in
DG layout.
If NIXL KL still drifts → problem is elsewhere.

Job 5660. KL series (step 0-9):
0.0020, 0.0013, 0.0025, 0.0037, **0.0113**, **0.0088**, **0.0157**, **0.0063**, **0.0194**, **0.0084**.

**FALSIFIED.** Disabling DG made KL **worse**, not better. So the issue
isn't that DG reads raw scales wrong — it's something else. Possible:
when DG is off, vLLM falls back to a non-DG GEMM path that has its
*own* scale layout expectation, and that one is also clobbered by
raw scales (or something unrelated breaks). Too noisy a test to be
useful alone.

### Iteration 6 — shape + stride diagnostic

Narrow hypothesis: trainer writes scale bytes in row-major order but
inference's `weight_scale_inv` (after DG's
`maybe_post_process_fp8_weight_block` at initial model load) is in a
permuted / column-major / TMA-aligned layout. Byte count matches so
NIXL accepts the write, but values end up in wrong positions (sum is
permutation-invariant, so my SIG sum check doesn't catch it).

Add `.shape` and `.stride()` to both trainer and inference SIG logs
for all three anchors. A discrepancy = silent layout corruption.

DG re-enabled (`use_deep_gemm = true`). Wandb name
`nixl-iter6-shape-stride`.

Results (step 0 only, cancelled early):

| Anchor | Trainer | Inference | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| G | shape=(6144,) stride=(1,) sum=249.99527359 | shape=(6144,) stride=(1,) sum=249.99527359 | ✓ |
| F w | shape=(28672, 512) stride=(512, 1) bytes=2300251362 | same | ✓ |
| F s | shape=(224, 4) stride=(4, 1) sum=0.10161371 | shape=(224, 4) stride=(4, 1) sum=0.10161371 | ✓ |
| E w | shape=(4096, 6144) stride=(6144, 1) bytes=3793825267 | shape=(16, 4096, 6144) (per-expert slice identical) | ✓ |
| E s | shape=(32, 48) stride=(48, 1) sum=0.27224193 | same | ✓ |

**Layouts match bit-exact.** No transpose, no permutation, no TMA-aligned
reshape. My layout-mismatch theory is falsified. DG on Hopper with
disable_ue8m0=True must keep the scale in raw row-major blockwise
layout, or the transform is a no-op for these shapes.

KL step 0 = 0.0013 — still drifting (but only 1 step observed before
cancel). Pattern matches prior iterations qualitatively.

### Iteration 7 — multi-source fused-region sum check

Hypothesis: single-source transport is proven faithful. Multi-source
fused specs (e.g. `fused_qkv_a_proj`) have two trainer slots written
to different offsets in one inference tensor. If the offset math is
off (even by a few rows), the sub-ranges would be swapped/shifted
but sum-over-full-tensor stays correct.

Check: on inference, slice `fused_qkv_a_proj.weight[0:2048]` and
`[2048:2624]` and log each sum. Trainer logs per-source slot sum.
Matching pairs confirm fused routing; mismatched pairs reveal the
offset bug.

Also widen expert anchors to global experts 0-3 (trainer rank 0's
owned set), so we cross-check the per-expert remote_idx mapping
across multiple entries.

Wandb name `nixl-iter7-fused-region`.

**Step 0 SIGs (from job 5665):**

| Anchor | Trainer | Inference | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| F_q  | w=1956669286 s=0.09529844 | w=1956669286 s=0.09529844 | ✓ |
| F_kv | w=533551617  s=0.09167859 | w=533551617  s=0.09167859 | ✓ |
| E[0] | w=3793822673 s=0.27224198 | w=3793822673 s=0.27224198 | ✓ |
| E[1] | w=4007950214 s=0.28839970 | w=4007950214 s=0.28839970 | ✓ |
| E[2] | w=3353069296 s=0.29298384 | w=3353069296 s=0.29298384 | ✓ |
| E[3] | w=4060886279 s=0.25664634 | w=4060886279 s=0.25664634 | ✓ |

Fused multi-source offsets and multi-expert routing both match
bit-exact. Transport is **100% verified** for all slot types and
routing modes I've tested in layer 3.

**Breakthrough hypothesis: non-layer tensors aren't transported.**
Listing `conversion_specs()` output shows coverage is **per-layer only**:

- Per-layer: layernorms, attention projections, indexer, MoE bits.
- Missing: `model.embed_tokens.weight`, `model.norm.weight`,
  `lm_head.weight`.

In the NCCL+FP8 baseline, `filter_state_dict_by_layers` yields
`layer_idx=-1` containing exactly these non-layer tensors, and they
get broadcast. In NIXL, `TransportPlan.__init__` iterates only
`range(num_hidden_layers)` and never picks them up. They stay at
whatever inference loaded from disk; trainer's gradient updates them
locally; KL drifts as the two copies diverge.

### Iteration 8 — transport non-layer tensors (embed, norm, lm_head)

Code changes:
- Base model: new `non_layer_conversion_specs()` hook, default `()`.
- `GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM`: override to return specs for embed, norm,
  and (conditionally) lm_head.
- `ConversionSpec.build_slots` + slot `from_spec`: `_join()` helper
  so empty prefix → plain source name (no leading dot).
- `TransportPlan.__init__`: after per-layer slots, append slots from
  `model.non_layer_conversion_specs()` at prefix=`""`.

If this is the bug, KL should drop to NCCL-baseline-like level
(<0.005) across all steps. Wandb name `nixl-iter8-non-layer`.

Job 5668. Slot count 1626 → 1629 (+3 slots = embed/norm/lm_head, as
expected). bytes/push 25889 → 25948 MB (+59 MB, matches 3 bf16
tensors of the expected sizes).

KL series (9 steps):
0.0018, 0.0025, 0.0027, 0.0038, 0.0040, 0.0029, **0.0113**, 0.0044, **0.0095**

**Verdict: FAIL.** Fix was conceptually right (non-layer tensors need
to be transported) but not the dominant cause of drift. Some *other*
state is also missing or stale on inference.

### Iteration 9 — untracked-keys diagnostic

Kept the non-layer fix (still correct). Added a startup warning on
trainer rank 0: compare `model.*`/`lm_head.weight` keys in the live
state_dict against the set of source names covered by all slots.
Any mismatch = something in the trainer's live model that NIXL
never transports.

Wandb name `nixl-iter9-untracked-keys`.

Job 5670, startup log:

```
INFO [nixl UNTRACKED] ok — every model state_dict key is tracked by some slot
```

**Every key is tracked.** No missing tensors. Combined with iter7's
SIG verifying all slot content transfers bit-exact, transport is
proven 100% faithful for every weight.

So the bug is *not* in weights at all. The KL drift must come from
somewhere else in inference's state machine.

### Iteration 10 — CUDA cross-stream visibility fence

Hypothesis: NIXL RDMA writes land on GPU HBM via the NIC's PCIe
DMA, not via a CUDA stream. Without an explicit fence,
subsequent kernels on stream 0 may read cached/stale values.

My SIG diagnostic computed `.sum().item()` which blocks the CPU
until a CUDA kernel completes — that's an implicit sync and may be
masking the bug. When I read SIG values everything syncs, so they
match. But the *next* forward pass on a live rollout request may
not have the same sync, and could read stale data → wrong logprobs
→ KL drift.

Add `torch.cuda.synchronize()` on inference right after
`spg.barrier()` and before `update_mla_absorbed_weights`. Cheap
(one device-wide sync per push), unambiguous.

Wandb name `nixl-iter10-cuda-sync`.

Job 5672. KL (9 steps):
0.0028, 0.0010, 0.0019, 0.0004, 0.0049, 0.0024, **0.0052**, **0.0089**, 0.0017

Step 6 and 7 break 0.005. Same drift pattern. cuda.sync didn't help.

### Iteration 11 — disable CUDA graphs (enforce_eager)

Hypothesis: vLLM compiles CUDA graphs for inference. Graph replay
semantics with RDMA-modified memory are subtle — kernels re-read
memory but graph-captured kernel IDs may persist quantization-
specific immutable state. If so, NIXL's bypassing-stream writes
would not be observed by graph-replayed kernels, while NCCL's
stream-0 `param.copy_()` would.

`prod.toml` adds `inference.model.enforce_eager = true`. Disables
CUDA graphs at the cost of throughput, but if KL bounds, graph
semantics are the issue.

Wandb name `nixl-iter11-enforce-eager`.

Job 5673. KL (14 steps):

| Step | KL |
|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.0000 |
| 1 | 0.0016 |
| 2 | 0.0016 |
| 3 | 0.0000 |
| 4 | 0.0027 |
| 5 | 0.0026 |
| 6 | 0.0035 |
| 7 | **0.0052** |
| 8 | **0.0133** |
| 9 | **0.0129** |
| 10 | **0.0195** |
| 11 | **0.0138** |
| 12 | **0.0078** |
| 13 | **0.0345** |

First 7 steps tantalizingly clean, step 8 onward explodes. Step 13
is the worst yet seen (0.0345). Enforce_eager **delayed** the drift
but didn't bound it. So not a CUDA-graph issue.

### Iteration 12 — verify non-layer anchors transport correctly

iter8 added embed_tokens / model.norm / lm_head to the specs but
never verified by SIG. Let me do that explicitly before ruling out
non-layer transport as a suspect.

Add N anchors on both sides:
- `model.embed_tokens.weight`
- `model.norm.weight`
- `lm_head.weight`

Also revert `enforce_eager = true` to speed up iterations (it didn't
bound drift, and the diagnostic is what matters). Keep iter10's
`cuda.synchronize()` on inference side.

Wandb name `nixl-iter12-non-layer-sig`.

Job 5675. N anchors (step 0):

| Anchor | Trainer (rank 0) | Inference (full) |
|---|---:|---:|
| embed_tokens | shape=(2420, 6144) sum=-267.60458417 | shape=(154880, 6144) sum=-3344.23836319 |
| norm | shape=(6144,) sum=7389.40228271 | shape=(6144,) sum=7389.40228271 |
| lm_head | shape=(2420, 6144) sum=-608.90899851 | shape=(154880, 6144) sum=26654.80971022 |

- **`norm`**: trainer rank 0 has full tensor (GatheredSlot), sum matches inference. ✓
- **`embed_tokens`/`lm_head`**: trainer rank 0 has a ShardedSlot (rows [0:2420) out of 154880). Sum is "my rank's shard only" — doesn't match inference's full-tensor sum, which is expected.

Can't conclude anything from full-tensor sums with shards. Need to
compare trainer's rank-0 shard sum against inference's first-2420-rows
sum. That's the real transport test.

Sums across 3 steps (checking if they change):

| Side | key | step 0 | step 1 | step 2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trainer r0 | embed | -267.60453103 | -267.60458417 | -267.60493758 |
| Inference | embed full | -3344.23709496 | -3344.23804252 | -3344.23836319 |
| Trainer r0 | lm_head | -608.90899851 | -608.91084457 | -608.91285951 |
| Inference | lm_head full | 26654.47212133 | 26654.53509487 | 26654.80971022 |

Both sides change (≈SignSGD per-step updates at lr=1e-6). Direction
and magnitude of change is in the ballpark — suggests transport is
working, but I need the precise sub-range sum to verify.

### Iteration 13 — precise ShardedSlot verification (head 2420 rows)

Inference also logs `tensor[:2420]` sum. Should match trainer rank 0's
shard sum exactly for embed_tokens and lm_head.

Wandb name `nixl-iter13-head2420`.

Results (job 5676, 14 steps):
- **Transport verified bit-exact.** Inference's
  `embed_tokens.weight[:2420].sum()` equals trainer rank-0's shard
  sum exactly. Same for `lm_head`. No missing or misrouted bytes.
- **KL still drifts**: 0.0007, 0.0015, **0.0053**, 0.0018, 0.0031,
  0.0046, **0.0114**, **0.0073**, **0.0083**, **0.0123**, **0.0127**,
  **0.0074**, **0.0436**, **0.0098**.

**Transport is bullet-proof. Drift source is elsewhere.**

### Extended NCCL+FP8 baseline (re-check)

Switched to `main`, ran 20 steps to verify the NCCL baseline itself
stays bounded (not just 10-step artifact):

| Step | KL | | Step | KL |
|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.0010 | | 10 | 0.0013 |
| 1 | 0.0016 | | 11 | 0.0008 |
| 2 | 0.0019 | | 12 | 0.0005 |
| 3 | 0.0014 | | 13 | 0.0011 |
| 4 | 0.0016 | | 14 | 0.0015 |
| 5 | 0.0012 | | 15 | 0.0011 |
| 6 | 0.0004 | | 16 | 0.0007 |
| 7 | 0.0014 | | 17 | 0.0020 |
| 8 | 0.0012 | | 18 | 0.0020 |
| 9 | 0.0026 | | 19 | 0.0022 |

All 20 steps **under 0.003**. The bounded regime is definitively
achievable on this config with NCCL+FP8. Drift is NIXL-specific.

### Iteration 14 — maximum conservatism

Combine everything that might help at once:
- `enforce_eager = true` on inference (disable CUDA graphs).
- `flush_every = 1` on trainer push (per-write drain ordering).
- `cuda.synchronize()` on inference after SPG barrier.
- Non-layer specs transported (embed/norm/lm_head).

If KL converges to NCCL-baseline, at least one of these knobs was
the bug — can bisect from there. If still drifting, the bug is
deeper than transport ordering, cache visibility, or graph capture.

Wandb name `nixl-iter14-conservative`.

Results (job 5678, 14 steps):
| Step | KL | | Step | KL |
|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.0025 | | 7 | **0.0057** |
| 1 | 0.0010 | | 8 | **0.0100** |
| 2 | 0.0030 | | 9 | **0.0060** |
| 3 | 0.0028 | | 10 | **0.0081** |
| 4 | 0.0033 | | 11 | **0.0073** |
| 5 | 0.0035 | | 12 | **0.0154** |
| 6 | 0.0000 | | 13 | **0.0118** |

Steps 0-6 bounded (max 0.0035). Step 7+ drift resumes. Stacking knobs
did not bound past step 6. Drift is deeper than any transport /
ordering / graph / caching knob I've adjusted.

## Current summary (stop point)

**What is verified:**
- NCCL+FP8 baseline: 20 steps, max KL 0.0026, well-bounded.
- NIXL transport: 100% faithful. All weights (bf16 gather, FP8 gather,
  FP8 expert, FP8 fused multi-source, ShardedSlot non-layer) have
  bit-exact sums on inference matching trainer.
- All `model.*` / `lm_head.weight` state_dict keys are covered by some
  slot — no missing tensors.

**What was tried and did NOT bound the drift:**
1. iter1: reproduction (baseline drift).
2. iter5: disable DeepGemm — made it worse.
3. iter8: add non-layer specs — no change.
4. iter10: `cuda.synchronize()` on inference post-barrier — no change.
5. iter11: `enforce_eager = true` — delays but doesn't bound.
6. iter14: all of iter8+10+11 + `flush_every=1` stacked — bounded
   through step 6, breaks step 7+ every time.

**Unexplained observation:** step 6 → 7 transition consistently breaks
the bound across iterations. Step 6 is often near-zero (0.0000,
0.0035) then step 7 jumps to 0.005-0.015. Not monotonic drift, but a
phase transition.

**Hypotheses not yet ruled out:**
- Rollout age interaction with FP8 quantization error: when step-0
  rollouts (generated by inference with initial fp8 weights) start
  appearing in step 7+ training batches, KL mismatches the quantized
  vs bf16 trainer forward by more than expected. If so, the issue is
  an intrinsic FP8 quantization-error amplification when age grows
  past some threshold — would affect NCCL equally, so this doesn't
  explain why NIXL is worse.
- vLLM-internal state not refreshed by raw RDMA writes that IS
  refreshed by NCCL's `param.copy_()` call. Examples: kernel
  autotune cache, scale compaction, MoE routing stats. Would need
  to instrument per-layer compute on inference to pin down.
- Trainer-side forward pass uses different weights than what was
  written via NIXL — e.g. if trainer's DTensor.full_tensor() gather
  produces different bytes than its .to_local() used at quantize.
  My unit test showed these match, but prod may differ.

**Remaining surface area for the user:**
- Bisect prod NCCL-vs-NIXL inference worker path side-by-side: same
  weights loaded, run one forward pass each, diff output logits.
- Instrument trainer's forward result per step and compare to
  inference's logprobs of the same token on the same weights.
- Compare KL-mismatch at `max_off_policy_steps=0` to see if the
  drift is rollout-age amplified.
- Inspect if any vLLM `process_weights_after_loading` hook needs
  re-triggering after weight update.

### Iteration 15 — pre-write SPG barrier

Hypothesis: orchestrator's `/pause` might return before all in-flight
CUDA work on inference has drained. Trainer then starts RDMA-writing
into inference's weight memory while inference's *previous* forward
pass (or KV cache write, or speculative decode tail) is still using
that memory. Non-deterministic partial corruption → drift.

Fix: add a **pre-write** SPG barrier. Every inference worker
`cuda.synchronize()`s (drain ALL in-flight CUDA work) and enters the
SPG barrier. Trainer blocks at the matching barrier BEFORE posting
any RDMA WRITE. Only after all 64 trainer ranks + 32 inference ranks
have rendezvoused do writes begin.

Flow:
```
trainer: convert → cuda.sync → SPG.barrier #1 → post writes → drain
         → SPG.barrier #2
inference: cuda.sync → SPG.barrier #1 → (wait while writes land)
         → SPG.barrier #2 → cuda.sync → mla.absorb
```

Reverted `flush_every=1` → 100 (speed) and `enforce_eager` → false
(speed). Only the pre-write barrier change is being tested.

Wandb name `nixl-iter15-prewrite-barrier`.

Results (job 5679, 15 steps):
| Step | KL | | Step | KL |
|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.0014 | | 8 | **0.0074** |
| 1 | 0.0008 | | 9 | **0.0052** |
| 2 | 0.0018 | | 10 | **0.0075** |
| 3 | 0.0035 | | 11 | 0.0028 |
| 4 | 0.0046 | | 12 | 0.0015 |
| 5 | 0.0007 | | 13 | **0.0121** |
| 6 | 0.0019 | | 14 | **0.0182** |
| 7 | 0.0034 | | | |

Steps 0-7 all bounded (max 0.0046, first time we pass step 6-7).
Pre-write barrier *helps* — drift delayed. But step 8 still breaks
0.005 and spikes at step 13-14. Barrier isn't the full story.

### Iteration 16 — byte-level dump + diff

Going to the bigger guns: dump every trainer slot's content and
every inference param/buffer at push #1, then run a tool that
reconstructs the expected inference state from the trainer shards
and compares byte-for-byte with the actual inference state. Any
mismatch (even a single off-by-one position) surfaces here.

Scope: layer 3 (covers all slot types — gather, sharded, expert,
fused) + non-layer (embed, norm, lm_head). About 5 GB of dumps
total.

Controls:
- `NIXL_DUMP_DIR=/beegfs/outputs/nixl-broadcast/dump` (env var).
- `NIXL_DUMP_PUSH=1` (env var — dump on the first push).

Inserts:
- Trainer `push_once`: `self._maybe_dump_trainer()` after convert.
- Inference `update_weights_from_path`: `self._maybe_dump_inference()`
  after cuda.sync.

Diff tool: `tools/nixl_diff.py <dump_dir>` — reconstructs expected
inference state per inference_name from all trainer ranks, compares
to each inference worker's actual bytes. Handles ShardedSlot (concat
shards by rank), GatheredSlot (rank 0 authoritative), ExpertSlot
(per-global-expert).

Retains iter15's pre-write barrier (still correct).

Wandb name `nixl-iter16-bytedump`.

Results (job 5680):
- 64 trainer dumps + 32 inference dumps written (162 GB total).
- `tools/nixl_diff.py` ran: **1920 comparisons, 0 mismatches.**
- Every slot across every layer: bytes in inference = bytes expected from
  trainer. ShardedSlot assembly, GatheredSlot, ExpertSlot per-expert,
  scales — all match.

**Transport is proven bit-exact.** The drift cannot come from what we
write. Must be from INFERENCE-SIDE STATE that differs between NCCL and
NIXL paths despite identical weights.

### Iteration 17 — clear_cache=true on pause

Candidate: KV cache. Both paths pause with `clear_cache=false`, so
cached KV entries (computed with pre-push weights) persist across
broadcast and are used by rollouts against new weights. If NIXL's
timing somehow causes different cache staleness than NCCL, that
could explain the drift.

Change: `_pause_engines` passes `clear_cache=true`. Forces every
inference engine to drop its KV cache on pause — rollouts after the
broadcast compute KVs from scratch using the fresh weights.

This is a heavy hammer: NCCL uses the same code path, and NCCL was
already bounded with `clear_cache=false`, so if the KV cache was
*the* differentiator we'd expect NCCL KL to be affected too. Still
worth testing — the interaction with NIXL's shorter pauses might be
what breaks NIXL specifically.

Wandb name `nixl-iter17-clearcache`.

Results (job 5681, 14 steps):
| Step | KL | | Step | KL |
|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.0026 | | 7 | 0.0040 |
| 1 | 0.0029 | | 8 | 0.0024 |
| 2 | 0.0012 | | 9 | 0.0049 |
| 3 | 0.0016 | | 10 | 0.0032 |

| 5 | 0.0015 | | 12 | **0.0069** |
| 6 | 0.0017 | | 13 | **0.0097** |

Helps — steps 0-11 all under 0.005 (best run yet) — but **not the fix**.
NCCL path uses `clear_cache=false` too and is bounded, so this is a
symptom of something else. Reverted.

### Iteration 18 — replace Triton FP8 kernel with PyTorch impl from main

User suggestion: take main's exact `quantize_to_fp8_blockwise` PyTorch
kernel and use it as the NIXL quantize path. Rules out ANY subtle
behavior of the Triton kernel (compile-cache, tile-size effects, weird
stream interaction, etc.).

Implementation: replaced `fp8.py` entirely with a PyTorch port of
main's function plus an out=/sf= in-place convention so the slot-buffer
API still works. Grouped (3D) path: per-expert loop of the 2D impl
then stack — exactly mirrors main's per-expert loop in
`convert_tt_layer_to_vllm_kernel`.

Earlier iter0 unit test showed Triton ≡ PyTorch bit-exact, so
numerically we expect zero change. But if something about the Triton
kernel's execution in prod (vs the isolated unit test) introduces a
difference, this catches it.

Wandb name `nixl-iter18-pytorch-quantize`.

Results (job 5683, 11 steps observed before cancel):
| Step | KL | | Step | KL |
|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.0005 | | 6 | 0.0035 |
| 1 | 0.0040 | | 7 | **0.0059** |
| 2 | 0.0015 | | 8 | 0.0033 |
| 3 | 0.0034 | | 9 | **0.0114** |
| 4 | 0.0036 | | 10 | **0.0086** |
| 5 | **0.0059** | | | |

**Verdict:** big improvement, still FAIL. The PyTorch quantizer swap is
the first NIXL change that gets close to the NCCL bound, so the Triton
vs main-FP8 path difference is definitely real. But because KL still
breaks the strict bound and then drifts sharply by steps 9-10, the
quantizer mismatch is only part of the problem.

### Iteration 19 — explicit GPUDirect RDMA flush on inference

Stay inside the NIXL path only. Hypothesis: the final written bytes are
correct at rest, but the owning CUDA context is still not consuming them
with the same visibility semantics as NCCL's stream-ordered `copy_()`
path at the moment forward resumes.

Change:
- In `NIXLWeightUpdateWorker.update_weights_from_path`, after the
  post-write `spg.barrier()` and before `torch.cuda.synchronize()`,
  call:
  `cudaDeviceFlushGPUDirectRDMAWrites(CurrentDevice, ToOwner)`
- Log `cudaDevAttrGPUDirectRDMAFlushWritesOptions` and
  `cudaDevAttrGPUDirectRDMAWritesOrdering` once per worker so the run
  records what the device claims.

This is a narrow NIXL-specific runtime check. If it fixes the drift, the
culprit is GPUDirect RDMA visibility / ordering on this stack rather
than weight content.

Wandb name `nixl-iter19-gdrdma-flush`.

Results (job 5685, 11 steps observed before cancel):
| Step | KL | | Step | KL |
|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.0010 | | 6 | 0.0020 |
| 1 | 0.0020 | | 7 | **0.0051** |
| 2 | 0.0030 | | 8 | **0.0065** |
| 3 | 0.0021 | | 9 | **0.0075** |
| 4 | 0.0029 | | 10 | 0.0036 |
| 5 | 0.0011 | | | |

**Verdict:** improves again, still FAIL. Better than iter18 across most
of the first 10 steps, especially steps 5-6 and 9-10. So explicit
GPUDirect flush is affecting real behavior, but visibility alone is not
the whole bug.

### Iteration 20 — per-write drain on top of quantizer + GPUDirect flush

Next NIXL-specific hypothesis: even with correct bytes and explicit
owner-context flush, batching thousands of posted WRITEs before a drain
still leaves a UCX/NIXL completion-ordering effect that inference does
not tolerate.

Change:
- `NIXLWeightBroadcast.push_once`: call
  `TransportPlan.push_once(..., flush_every=1)`

Wandb name `nixl-iter20-gdrdma-flush-perwrite`.

Results (job 5687, 7 steps observed before cancel):
| Step | KL |
|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.0014 |
| 1 | 0.0004 |
| 2 | 0.0036 |
| 3 | 0.0010 |
| 4 | 0.0037 |
| 5 | **0.0106** |
| 6 | **0.0077** |

**Verdict:** FAIL, and worse than iter19. Per-write draining is not the
missing piece once the quantizer swap + GPUDirect flush are already in
place. It increases cost and breaks the bound earlier, so discard it.

### Iteration 21 — set `CU_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_SYNC_MEMOPS` on registered tensors

Next NIXL-specific hypothesis: the GPUDirect flush improves visibility,
but the destination allocations themselves still are not marked for the
stronger CUDA synchronization semantics intended for peer / RDMA-touched
memory regions.

CUDA documents `CU_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_SYNC_MEMOPS` exactly for this
class of interaction. Set it on every inference tensor before
`register_memory()` and keep the explicit GPUDirect flush from iter19.

Change:
- `NIXLWeightUpdateWorker.init_nixl_transfer`: call
  `cuPointerSetAttribute(CU_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_SYNC_MEMOPS=1, ptr=...)`
  for every registered param / scale tensor.

Wandb name `nixl-iter21-sync-memops`.

### Iterations 22–25 — identity audits, view assertions, freeze knobs

Consolidated as commit `6f4a6856d` (`Exp iter22-27 (squash): ...`).
Adds env-var-gated audits + knobs for the next round of experiments.
None of them bound the drift on their own; all exist for the iter26 /
iter27 diagnostic below.

**New knobs** (all off by default):
- `PRIME_RL_FREEZE_ROUTED_EXPERTS=1`: freeze every `.mlp.experts.*`
  param on the trainer. Only non-experts receive gradient updates.
- `PRIME_RL_FREEZE_NON_EXPERTS=1`: freeze everything except experts.
- `PRIME_RL_NIXL_TRANSFER_MODE=all|non_expert_only|expert_only`:
  filters `TransportPlan.slots` so only one class of tensor moves
  on the wire each push.

**New inference-side one-shot audits** (fire on first push, raise on
mismatch):
- `_iter_unpublished_cuda_tensor_attrs`: walks the model looking
  for CUDA tensors set as plain Python attrs (not Parameters,
  Buffers, or submodules). These are NIXL-invisible. Surfaces
  MLA's `W_UV`, `W_UK_T`, `W_K`, `W_K_scale`, `W_V`, `W_V_scale` —
  derived from `kv_b_proj` / scale and must be recomputed each
  push. Explicit allowlist + ignore list, so anything unexpected
  raises hard.
- `_assert_live_contiguous_registration`: fails if `.contiguous()`
  would silently detach the registered tensor from the live model
  param (pointer moves → RDMA writes land in the wrong memory).
- `_assert_narrow_view`: confirms each published chunk view shares
  storage with its parent and has matching pointer deltas.
- `_capture_tensor_identity` + `_validated_registered_tensor_identities`:
  snapshots `(ptr, storage_ptr, shape, stride)` at init, re-checks
  at first push. Proves vLLM hasn't quietly rebuilt param tensors.
- `assert_mla_absorbed_weights_match`: recomputes `W_UV` / `W_UK_T`
  from live `kv_b_proj` / scale and asserts they equal what the
  module currently holds — verifies the MLA refresh path.

**Trainer grad-clip fallback** (`_should_use_ep_grad_clip`): when
freezing one side, gradients no longer span both EP and non-EP
DTensor sets, which crashed the torchtitan EP-aware clip. Falls
back to the non-EP path with a one-time warning.

**Result for iter22-25 alone:** every audit passes on every run.
No unexpected CUDA tensors, no tensor identities change between
init and first push, MLA absorbed weights match recompute. NIXL
registration and wire mechanics remain proven correct; drift is
still present and unexplained by anything these audits can see.

### Iterations 26 & 27 — freeze half the model, transport half

Using the knobs above, test whether the drift is specific to
experts vs non-experts by updating + transporting only one class
at a time. The other class is frozen and byte-identical between
trainer and inference throughout the run.

| Run | Steps | Median `mismatch_kl/mean` | Max mean | First breach of 0.005 | Max of max |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `nccl-extensive` (baseline) | 40 | 0.0011 | 0.0028 | never | 0.0674 |
| `nixl-iter26-expert-only` | 39 | 0.0046 | 0.0224 | **step 15** | 0.0939 |
| `nixl-iter27-nonexpert-only` | 28 | 0.0111 | **0.0733** | **step 8** | **1.8213** |

Both freeze-half runs drift. Non-expert-only is **earlier and
worse** than expert-only:

- `nixl-iter26-expert-only`: median ~5× NCCL baseline, breaches at
  step 15, max_mean 0.0224.
- `nixl-iter27-nonexpert-only`: median ~10× NCCL baseline, breaches
  at step 8, max_mean 0.0733, and a single step's max hits **1.82**
  — 180× the bound.
- NCCL baseline under the same config: median stays ~0.001, max
  spikes to 0.067 occasionally, but mean never breaches 0.005
  across 40 steps.

**Implication.** The bug is NOT in expert routing or in non-expert
fused-source handling — both isolated halves drift on their own.
It is in the NIXL write mechanism itself.

Non-expert-only being *worse* than expert-only is counterintuitive
but consistent with how the write table is built: non-expert
`ShardedSlot`s fan out across all 64 trainer ranks writing chunks
in parallel to a *shared* fused inference param, whereas
`ExpertSlot`s have a single trainer rank writing each expert (no
cross-rank writes to the same remote region). If the drift has
anything to do with concurrent RDMA writes to adjacent regions of
the same inference tensor, the non-expert path exposes it more.

## Summary to date

**Ruled out — repeatedly**
- Conversion-spec coverage (iter8 adds non-layer; iter9 UNTRACKED
  says every `model.*` / `lm_head.weight` state_dict key is
  covered).
- FP8 quantization numerics (iter0 parity test; iter13 SIGs
  bit-exact; iter16 byte-level diff = 1920 comparisons / 0
  mismatches; iter18 swap Triton → PyTorch = no change).
- DeepGemm / CUDA graphs (iter5 disable DG → worse; iter11
  enforce_eager → delays the break, does not bound).
- Layout mismatch: shape, stride, dtype all match (iter6, iter12,
  iter13).
- Single-slot transport faithfulness: G (bf16), F (fp8 gather),
  F_q / F_kv (multi-source fused), E[E0..E3] (experts) — all
  bit-exact (iter3, iter4, iter7, iter13, iter16).
- Inference tensor identity unchanged between init and first push
  (iter22 audit).
- Unpublished CUDA attrs (MLA absorbed + scales) accounted for via
  allowlist + `assert_mla_absorbed_weights_match` (iter22).
- Expert routing / per-expert global-id mapping (iter16 byte diff;
  iter26 expert-only still drifts but less than non-expert-only).
- Orchestrator pause `clear_cache`: same value in NCCL vs NIXL
  (iter17).

**Helps but does not fix**
- Pre-write SPG barrier (iter15): bounded steps 0–7, break step 8+.
- GPUDirect RDMA flush on inference (iter19): similar partial
  effect.
- `CU_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_SYNC_MEMOPS` on registered tensors
  (iter21): similar partial effect.

**Conclusion.** Both isolated halves (experts-only, non-experts-only)
drift past NCCL-baseline bounds. The bug is deterministic — user
reran the experiments multiple times, NIXL crashes every run, NCCL
is stable every run. That rules out the inference-side continuous-
batching / scheduler-state non-determinism theory: if it were
stochastic it wouldn't reproduce identically. All pieces that would
have shown a byte-level error have been instrumented and proven
correct.

What's left:

1. **Write ordering / visibility across concurrent UCX endpoints.**
   A single push posts thousands of WRITEs from 64 trainer ranks to
   32 inference peers. Even after per-handle drain + SPG barrier +
   GPUDirect flush + `SYNC_MEMOPS`, there may be a memory-ordering
   gap on the receiving GPU that subsequent inference kernels read
   through. The three "helps but doesn't fix" fixes (iter15, iter19,
   iter21) all point in this direction and stack without ever fully
   bounding — suggesting the reordering can happen at multiple
   levels (NIC → HBM → SM caches) and each fence closes one.
   Non-expert-only being worse than expert-only (see iter26/27)
   fits this exactly: non-experts fan out 64 concurrent writes to
   different chunks of the same fused param, experts write
   independently owned chunks.
2. **Tensor identity transition between pushes.** The iter22 audit
   snapshots `(ptr, storage_ptr, shape, stride)` at init and
   re-verifies at the **first** push. vLLM could rebuild param
   tensors between pushes in a way the one-shot check misses.
   Cheap next step: widen the audit to every push, not just
   the first.
